  <p>Last night, I saw <span class="word word-adjective-1"></span> puppy and I brought him to my home. He was so <span class="word word-adjective-2"></span>. He chewed my <span class="word word-artSupply"></span> with his little teeth. I named him as <span class="word word-artistName"></span> and gave him <span class="word word-numbers-2"></span> different kinds of <span class="word word-foods-2"></span>. I opened up <span class="word word-computerSoftware"></span> to make a video of it. I posted the video on <span class="word word-websiteName"></span>. After a week, I was so surprised to hear that <span class="word word-celebrityName"></span> knows my video. I got <span class="word word-noun1"></span> and <span class="word word-noun2"></span> as gifts. <span class="word word-celebrityName"></span> even wanted to see him! We met at <span class="word word-placeInNewYork"></span>. <span class="word word-celebrityName"></span> was <span class="word word-verbEndingInIng"></span>. But I ignored <span class="word word-celebrityName"></span>. As we talked about a few minutes, suddenly <span class="word word-pluralNoun1"></span> fell down from the sky. <span class="word word-celebrityName"></span> took <span class="word word-pluralNoun2"></span> from his pocket and blocked <span class="word word-pluralNoun1"></span>. <span class="word word-pluralNoun1"></span> became <span class="word word-pluralNoun3"></span>. <span class="word word-pluralNoun3"></span> looked like <span class="word word-bodyPart"></span>. We were so freaked out. <span class="word word-numbers-1"></span> of the <span class="word word-pluralNoun3"></span> were speaking in English!</p>
