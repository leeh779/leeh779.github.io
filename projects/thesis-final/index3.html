              <p class="p-serif txt-f"><br><br>Most of microaggressions are not reported because it is hard to record the unexpected incidents. If you are passing by, please take attention to those incidents. Record them in any way you can do as soon as possible. If you are getting attacked, get assistance from people around you. When you ask for help, it is more effective to call someone with a specific description, not shouting to a random person. It can be frustrating and triggering to go through all the processes, but at the end it will be a huge help to make your voice heard a bit more than before and support Asian communities. You can download the resources below to learn more about reporting, written by law officers.</p>

Although they do not say anything about anti-asian microaggressions, some might have hurt a lot and some might have been ignoring the situation. Support your friends by asking if they are doing okay and if there is anything you can help them. Even if they have not experienced anti-asian violences, show your empathy will mean a lot for them. If you are suffering from racially-motivated incidents, share your story with your friends and make your voice heard.</p>
