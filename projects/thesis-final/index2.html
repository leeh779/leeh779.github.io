            <p class="p-quote">When I was young, my family had shortly stayed in Indianapolis, and we experienced microagression often. For example, we went to rent a car and the lot was full of rent-a-cars, but still they told us that they didn't have any cars to rent out and a black family that came when we were leaving could get a car right away.</p>

            <p class="p-quote">I've experienced Anti-Asian violence multiple times. Thankfully, there were no physical attacks, but there were many harassments and threats that I've got in the past. One time, we went to the mall in Atlanta, GA, and one guy came to my family and said go back to your country, you guys are useless, and we don't need Asians in the United States. My family got so scared, so we immediately left the mall, and because of that, we don't go to that specific mall anymore. Also, when I was in high school, my classmate harassed me sexually because he had a "yellow fever." </p>

            <p class="p-quote">A few times when I was studying in New Zealand. It was 10~ 11 years ago, I was high school student in Christ Church which is southern city in NZ. It was often hearing swear or any abusive language from strangers on the road. Most of my asian friends experienced same thing as well. And I also got physical attack on the road when it was dark by drunken people. </p>

            <p class="p-quote">A lot of it were micro aggressions when I was younger and totally unprovoked since I was doing nothing whenever it happened. A few I remember was when I first moved to the US in elementary school, kids would pull their eyes to make them squint and tease me. At the time I was too young and barely spoke english to realize what they were doing. Then in high school by older guys on my bus who would come to where me and my cousin sat. They would squint their eyes and say things like “ching chong” while laughing about it amongst themselves. Even as an adult now living in a dense asian community, I run across people who would speed along the road on their bikes yelling racial slurs at all of us.</p>

            <p class="p-quote">I’ve never experienced direct anti-asian violence. However, I did experience micro-level racism in predominantly white communities (Rhode Island, classes/dorms back in USC). For instance: not making a single eye contact with me while I talk, instead only choosing to look at/talk to my non-Asian friend during the whole conversation. </p>

            <p class="p-quote">At first it was just a plain hatred towards me. The person I was. It made me feel less than what I was, smaller, made me try harder to lay low so I wouldn't stand out. Especially when you are young, you don't really get the concept of racism. So growing up I simply thought I was less than others, or that people generally didn't like me unless I became 'likable'. Now I feel exploited, angry… 
              angry at those who make racist, sexist, and fetish-y comments thinking that they can do that to somebody who they feel is 'weaker' than them.</p>

            <p class="p-quote">To be honest, as I was far away from family and I was teenager, I felt myself it is my fault that I don’t look strong enough. I thought that people did abusive and racisim thing to me because I looked physically weak. And when I was 19, get used to living in NZ, I felt nothing about verbal violence but The experience of physical attack from drunken people was hard to recover. Never walked outside at night since then.</p>
