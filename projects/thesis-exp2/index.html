                Welcome! You are now exploring creative web badges back in 1994. Why 1994? Because it's the time when unique individuals started gathering online called GeoCities. It was "an important outlet for personal expression on the Web for almost 15 years." While we use social media to express ourselves and connect with other people these days, digital nomads in the past used GeoCities. Pages in Geocities were identified by numbers and categorized into different interests similar to what we use as a hashtag on social media.<br><br> 
                Though there were technical difficulties such as traffic limits and noise in graphics, users on Geocities utilized creative methods to express themselves with different ways of organizing the contents, layout, and hyperlinks. Even just for an email link, they had distinctive design choices that made every single website so special. Users back in 1994 fully customized the website through those unique representations.<br><br>
                This web page stores an archive of those unique self-expressions with no limits in design choices such as size, format, and context. They are collected from the pages on GeoCities under the category of Soho, where the artists freely express themselves through GIF badges. You can have fun with randomize the badges by clicking <a onClick="window.location.reload();">RELOAD</a>. Also, there is a hidden button that you could travel to the future!<br><br>
