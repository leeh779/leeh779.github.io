          According to Dar Meshi, a cognitive neuroscientist at Michigan State University, "this modern social reward system activates the ventral striatum, a part of the brain that focuses on decision making and reward-related behavior. It’s the same area that’s fired up when people gamble, enjoy a slice of cake or have sex, and cognitive neurologist Ofir Turel thinks this is why checking social media is so enticing."<br><br><a id="btn-to3" class="body-new-2-next">read more...</a></p>

          While this reward system creates fun and enticing experiences, this endless nudge keeping us to stay on social media. Therefore, we get easily distracted with constant social comparison and lose time to identify who we are. Compared to the past when people presented web badges for expressing values that they support, it became more vulnerable for people to demonstrate what they stand for. It is danger to identify yourself with the numbers of Likes, whether you get verification from the platform. Reward system is just one way to enjoy web.
