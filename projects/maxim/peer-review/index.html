    <h1>Peer review for Amal</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>On first glance, what would you expect to be able to do with this website?<br>To experience the content and concept that designer wants to convey.</li>
      <li>What is the content of this website?<br>Quotes from a book, Freaks.</li>
      <li>Does the form of the website feel intentional? Does it reflect part of the concept?<br>Yes. Black and white color gives me a sense of seriousness feeling and this reflects the concept well.</li>
      <li>Is any information missing?<br>No.</li>
      <li>Are any of the design features distracting, out of place, or unnecessary?<br>Too many changes in layout.</li>
      <li>What kind of formal design principles is the designer utilizing well? What can be improved and how? (Typography, scale, color, composition..)<br>Contrast of black and white color goes well with the contents and the way she translate them.</li>
      <li>Does the scale of the design feel appropriate to the device?<br>Yes.</li>
      <li>What, if anything, would make this easier to use and understand?<br>Font size in some Urdu sentences looks different from English sentences in the page. It’ll be better to be smaller than now.</li>
      <li>What kind of navigation is involved in this prototype? Is it clear? Why or why not.<br>Horizontal scrolling.</li>
      <li>What, if anything, would you change about this website so far?<br>Remove the title in each page because you already showed it in the first page.</li>
      <li>Do the design decisions feel appropriate for the concept and content of the website? How do you see the two being related right now.<br>They feel appropriate and I like her color choice since it’s clearly conveying the message and gives me serious feeling. I think the concept and the content is well-related.</li>
      <li>Is this website a memorable execution of this idea? Why or why not? What is most memorable?<br>I think it’s memorable because she’s using translation effectively by adopting appropriate layouts.</li>
      <li>Any final thoughts or comments?<br>I like the variation of layouts you have but I’m thinking it would be better to reduce the number of them. Love your idea of how you present two different languages in the same page!</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>For the Designer</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>What did you gather from the peer review? What, if anything, did you adjust in your design?<br>Amal suggested me to have bolder texts so I might be trying to have all texts in bold.</li>
      <li>What, if anything, did you take away from this exercise?<br>I was thinking of having both circle layout and reflection ideas but I changed my mind to just choose one layout and it would be vertical texts.<br>Circle layout looks visually interesting but in terms of conveying the concept and idea, overlaying texts is better.</li>
    </ol>
